## Legal Compliance

### Author Authorization

**September 8, 2025**:
- Author agreed to MIT license development
- Author has no objection to studying foobar2000 DR Meter
- Provided technical specification document for DR measurement
- Specification: [Measuring DR ENv3 (Official PDF)](https://web.archive.org/web/20131206121248/http://www.dynamicrange.de/sites/default/files/Measuring%20DR%20ENv3.pdf)

Special thanks to the original author for support and understanding!

### Implementation Approach

- Completely rewritten in Rust (original in C++)
- Independent modular design and code structure
- Original implementation based on mathematical formulas
- Algorithm verified through input/output comparison

### AI Collaboration

- Thanks to Anthropic Claude 4.5 models (Sonnet / Haiku) for implementing the majority of the codebase
- Thanks to OpenAI GPT-5 and Codex models for contributing additional code and providing the bulk of reviews & refinements
